# Hearthline — project context for Claude

This file is loaded by Claude Code on every conversation. It captures the
"why" and "how" of Hearthline so I don't have to re-explain it each time.

---

## What this project is

**Hearthline** is an open-source AI front desk for home-service teams (HVAC,
plumbing, roofing, solar, energy renovation, garage, electrical, landscaping,
cleaning, pest control). AGPL-3.0 licensed (commercial license available). Built in public.

Tagline: *"The 24/7 AI front desk for home services."*

The product:
- A persona named **Anna** answers every inbound call via Vapi, qualifies the
  lead, books a slot, and sends an SMS confirmation.
- Captures multi-channel touches (phone, SMS, WhatsApp, email, web chat).
- Drafts quotes live on the call from the configured knowledge base / price list.
- Writes structured leads into a Django dashboard the business owner uses.

Live demo target: **hearthline.codewithmuh.com**.
Repo target: **github.com/newajme/hearthline-ai-assistant** (public, AGPL-3.0).

## Who's behind it

- **Muhammad Rashid (@codewithmuh)** — content creator, 25K+ YouTube subs,
  channel focused on AI build-along videos.
- Site: https://codewithmuh.com
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-rashid-daha/
- YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@codewithmuh
- X: https://x.com/codewithmuh
- Calendly: https://calendly.com/contact-codewithmuh/30min

The business model is **OSS first, done-for-you setup paid**. Companies
self-host (or pay Rashid to deploy). No multi-tenant SaaS yet.

## Key URLs / endpoints

**Public dashboard routes:**
- `/` landing (marketing)
- `/faq`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/docs` — legal + OSS docs
- `/dashboard` — Overview (KPIs + Recent Interactions)
- `/dashboard/leads` (`+ /[id]`), `/dashboard/calls`, `/dashboard/quotes` (`+ /new`, `/[id]`)
- `/dashboard/customers`, `/dashboard/support`, `/dashboard/settings`, `/dashboard/test-call`

**API endpoints:**
- `GET  /api/health/`
- `GET  /api/businesses/`, `/api/leads/`, `/api/calls/`, `/api/quotes/`
- `GET/PATCH /api/leads/<id>/`, `/api/quotes/<id>/`
- `POST /api/calls/webhooks/vapi/`             (Vapi end-of-call report)
- `POST /api/calls/webhooks/twilio/`           (Twilio voice/SMS)
- `POST /api/calls/vapi/chat/completions/`     (Vapi custom-LLM, OpenAI-compatible)

## How Anna's agent loop works

1. Vapi handles STT + TTS, POSTs the running conversation to
   `/api/calls/vapi/chat/completions/` on every turn.
2. View converts OpenAI-format messages → Claude format, runs the loop in
   `apps/calls/agent/receptionist.py`.
3. Claude can call tools (`qualify_lead`, `check_availability`,
   `book_appointment`, `draft_quote`, `send_sms`, `send_email`, `end_call`).
   Tool dispatchers are in `apps/calls/services/`.
4. Lead/Customer rows are created/updated as Anna learns more.
5. Final response returns as OpenAI completion. SSE streaming supported.
   `X-Vapi-End-Call: true` header tells Vapi to hang up.

If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is missing the agent returns a friendly stub so dev never crashes.

## Commands

### Local dev (Docker Compose)

```bash
docker compose up --build              # 3 services: db, backend, frontend
docker compose exec backend python manage.py seed_demo --wipe   # seed demo data
docker compose exec backend python manage.py seed_admin         # default admin / hearthline login
docker compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser    # custom superuser
```

URLs:
- http://localhost:3000 — Next.js dashboard
- http://localhost:8000/admin — Django admin
- http://localhost:8000/api — REST API

### Production VPS (Path B)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

Caddy handles auto-HTTPS via Let's Encrypt. Backend must have `API_DOMAIN`
and `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` env vars.

### Vercel (Path A — preferred for the demo)

Push to GitHub → import on vercel.com/new → Vercel reads root `vercel.json`
and deploys both services. Run migrations from laptop pointed at Neon.

## Coding conventions

- **No comments unless the *why* is non-obvious.** The *what* is the code.
- **Short PRs.** One concern at a time.
- **No emojis in code unless the user explicitly asks.** OK in CSS for UI badges.
- **Tailwind is NOT used.** All styles live in `frontend/app/globals.css` —
  intentional, keeps the design system in one place. Don't bring in Tailwind
  or styled-components.
- **No `any` in TypeScript without a `// reason:` comment.**
- **Python:** PEP 8, type hints encouraged. The pylint warnings about
  `Class 'X' has no 'objects' member` are pylint-django false positives —
  ignore them.
- **Django models** stay in `apps/<app>/models.py`. Migrations live in
  `apps/<app>/migrations/`.
- **Marketing landing pages** must NEVER use realistic PII. The mock dashboard
  uses `Customer 001`–`Customer 008` with `+1 (000) 123-4567` phone numbers
  and `example.test` emails. The internal dashboard (behind `/dashboard`) can
  use realistic-feeling seed data — that's a deliberate split.

## Things to remember (lessons from earlier conversations)

1. **Never frame Hearthline as a "Bravi alternative."** Position as its own
   project. The user explicitly corrected this.
2. **Anna is the recurring brand character** — voice persona, chat widget AI,
   Test Call simulator. Use her name consistently.
3. **The user is a content creator.** The repo's purpose is to drive YouTube
   build-along videos and Calendly bookings for done-for-you setups, NOT to
   become a SaaS.
4. **Brand presence:** "by codewithmuh" pill in the topbar + creator credit
   row in the footer (codewithmuh.com, LinkedIn, YouTube, X, GitHub).
5. **No real customer testimonials.** No fake "X said about us" quotes. The
   project doesn't have customers yet — be honest.
6. **Dashboard demo data uses realistic names** (Mark Johnson etc.) but
   the marketing page does NOT. Don't mix these.
7. **Two deploy paths supported** (Vercel multi-service OR Vercel + VPS) —
   don't drop one for the other without asking.
8. **Hot reload caveats:** when CSS/component changes don't appear, the cause
   is usually browser cache. Tell the user to hard-refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
   before debugging further.
9. **MockDashboard data must be deterministic on first render** — it caused
   a hydration mismatch when `Math.random()` ran at module load. New random
   rows only appear inside `useEffect` after mount.

## What NOT to add

- ❌ Tailwind CSS or any other CSS framework
- ❌ Multi-tenant auth / billing (stays out of OSS until traction proves it)
- ❌ Fake customer logos in the trusted-by strip
- ❌ Fake testimonials / case studies
- ❌ Realistic-looking PII on the marketing page
- ❌ Background jobs requiring a queue (no Celery / Redis) — Vercel doesn't
  support long-running workers; use Vercel Cron + a separate function if
  needed
- ❌ Server-Sent Events on the dashboard (works, but adds complexity Vercel
  serverless doesn't love)

## Things in flight / roadmap

**Shipped**
- Django data model (Business, Channel, Customer, Lead, Conversation, Message, Call, Quote, LineItem)
- Vapi custom-LLM endpoint with structured Claude tool loop
- OpenAI Vision → drafted quote with line items + tax + total
- Next.js dashboard: Overview, Leads, Calls, Quotes (editable + browser-print PDF), Customers, Settings, Test Anna
- Lead-detail conversation timeline + extracted_fields JSON inspector
- `seed_demo` management command
- Docker Compose local + production stacks
- Vercel multi-service deploy config

**In progress / next**
- Stripe checkout for deposit collection on quote acceptance
- Outbound SMS / WhatsApp via Twilio for quote delivery
- Multi-tenant auth (today: single business)
- PDF rendering server-side (replacing browser print path)
- Real Google Calendar integration in `services/scheduling.py`

**Open issues**
- Subsidy lookup integration (solar / energy renovation)
- Tech dispatch + GPS routing for booked jobs
- Review request automation (Google + Trustpilot webhooks)
- Eval harness for the Anna prompt

## Style for content (when generating YouTube titles, README sections, etc.)

- Lead with the **outcome** ("From first ring to final invoice"), not the tech.
- Use the build-along voice: "I shipped X. Here's the code."
- Keep tagline punchy. Avoid corporate language ("empowering teams to…").
- Do NOT compare to competitors by name in copy. Position as standalone.
